       	<h2>Geostatistics </h2>
       		<p>
        	Geostatistics is a branch of applied statistics that place emphasis on the geological context of the available data. The spatial relationship between the data comes from such context and needs to be reproduced after geological modeling. Integration of different sources of data with different level of precision and coming from different volumetric support is the main challenge in geostatistical modeling. An important aspect of geostatistical modeling is to quantify the uncertainty that originates from our lack of knowledge about the truth. Stochastic geostatistical simulation based on Monte Carlo sampling is often employed to generate equally probable realizations of the geological model that represent the geological uncertainty at all locations.

       	<h5>Practical Integration of 4D Seismic in Reservoir Modeling</h5>

		<p>
		4D seismic is a dynamic source of data that provides information about changes in reservoir-rock and -fluid properties over time. Seismic attributes are sensitive to variations in the fluid content, temperature, and pressure distribution; therefore, 4D-seismic images contain information on the nature of fluid flow within the reservoir. Perhaps the most-reliable and-important information that can be learned from 4D-seismic images is related to anomalies in fluid flow within the reservoir. During steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), the steam-chamber propagation is fairly clear from 4D-seismic images, mainly because of higher gas saturation in the chamber. Therefore, anomalies are revealed by the absence or unexpected location of the steam chamber. In this research, a practical methodology is proposed for consideration of anomalies identified from 4D-seismic images in geostatistical reservoir models. The geostatistical realizations are updated to enforce missing anomalies and improve reservoir characterization. The updated models are suitable for reservoir decision making and management.</p>

	  <h5>Facies proportion uncertainty in presence of a trend</h5>

		<p>Categorical variable modeling is of great significance for resource estimation as it defines a major aspect of geological heterogeneity and uncertainty. Stochastic simulation can be used to generate multiple equally-probable realizations that describe the uncertainty in the spatial distribution of categorical variables such as facies. These realizations reasonably sample the space of uncertainty if the input statistics are well known. However, the input statistics are often poorly defined due to sparse data. The prior parameter uncertainty related to proportions of different categories is required to achieve an accurate evaluation of the space of uncertainty. For decision making and risk analysis, it is critical to have an accurate and precise model of uncertainty associated with 3924 the subsurface geology. A methodology is proposed, implemented and checked to quantify parameter uncertainty related to facies proportions in presence of a locally varying proportion model (a trend model). Unconditional sequential indicator simulation (SIS) is employed to implement the spatial bootstrap and quantify the prior proportion uncertainty. A trend building algorithm provides multiple realizations of the trend model based on the spatial bootstrap realizations of sampled data. Passing this prior parameter uncertainty through geostatistical simulation provides a realistic posterior model of uncertainty that accounts for the data configuration, conditioning, spatial correlation, and the domain limits.</p>

	    <h5>Automated Well Upscaling Tool</h5>
	    <p>The challenge of proper upscaling for permeability and facies is addressed in this reserahc work. Permeability is upscaled using two main options: 1) power law averaging based on professional judgment 2) LU co-simulation of vertical and horizontal permeability followed by flow simulation to calculate the effective directional permeability. Also, the loss of information during facies upscaling may be addressed through records of a relevant petrophysical property (i.e., shale volume or porosity).</p>

	    <h5>A User Guide for SAGD Semi-Analytical Simulator</h5>
	    <p>According to the Canadian association of petroleum producers, Canada has the third largest oil reserves in the world and 97 percent of these reserves are located in the oil sands. This natural resource plays a key role in the economy of Canada. Oil sands are a natural mixture of sand, water, clay and bitumen 1 . Although in Canada, some bitumen may be found near the surface, the majority of bitumen reserves are located deeper underground. On the other hand, conventional methods cannot be used for oil production due to the high viscosity of bitumen. In this regard, thermal recovery methods have been considered as effective solutions for bitumen production in such reservoirs. Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is one of the most common thermal recovery methods for heavy oil production. Numerical modeling of thermal recovery methods such as SAGD provides a reliable tool to assess the performance of a reservoir and develop proper production plans. The commercial thermal simulators are capable of modeling the details of the SAGD process and consider almost all the complicated mechanisms involved in thermal oil recovery. However, the run time for a 3D heterogeneous model with one well pair can exceed 2 days. In this regard, a guide book was developed for a semi-analytical thermal simulator of SAGD. This simulator can act as a proxy for a sophisticated thermal simulator like STARS (Computer Modelling Group Ltd.). In this guide book a comprehensive user manual is presented.</p>

	    <h5>Facies Proportion Calibration</h5>
	    <p>Stochastic facies simulation often results in slight deviation of proportions from target/input proportions. If the global proportions are inferred by high level of confidence, it may be required to modify the facies realization to match a set of target proportions. An algorithm based is implemented to identify and rank grid cells that can be modified to enforce target proportions. A kernel weighting system accounts for distance around a cell to find a measure of fitness for the modification. Conditioning data and their spatial continuity are considered as a constraint in this process. This tool can also bes used for sensitivity analysis based on facies proportions.</p>

	    <h5>Smart Selection/Sampling of a Multivariate Space</h5>
	    <p>Pooling a limited number of realizations/observations out of a large number is often necessary for cross validation. Also, processing many realizations is often not practical due to the computational cost. In this context, an algorithm is developed to select a limited number of realizations that reproduce the same multivariate relationships.</p>

	    <h5>VTK Visualization</h5>
	    <p>Visualization of reservoir models is often very important to assess the results. Paraview is a great tool for visualization of big data set and grid model. Figure below shows one example of using VTK format for visualization of unstructured grids along with surface triangulation. The VTK file is generated using MATLAB/Python.</p>
