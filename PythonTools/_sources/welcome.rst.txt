Welcome
=======

Python is an interpreted high-level programming language with lots of free, open source packages. I use python for data query, data analysis, machine learning and visualization. PythonTools is a collection of Python libraries that I have developed and used for different projects. Please feel free to go over its documentation and let me know if you are interested to use any of the provided tools. 

Features:

* Connection to different database servers for data query
* Data analysis/mining
* Visualization
* Machine Learning
